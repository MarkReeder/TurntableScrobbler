This is a Chrome extension that will allow you to scrobble to Last.FM what is being played on the social DJ service Turntable.FM.

* Install it
* Authenticate to Last.FM
* Reload your Turntable.FM browser tab (I'll fix this soon if people actually use this)

Note: There's currently no handling of errors on Last.FM's side.

Enjoy your DJ'ing!
